Here’s where I scribble my data science experiments and early explorations.
It’s my personal playground for data science drafts.

Note that this repository is used only for storing drafts and initial
explorations of libraries, languages, technologies, etc. This indicates that it
is not intended to house projects, optimized code, or well-architected files in
general. If you want to view my more organized data for the Data Science area,
visit the repository [dataScience_showcase](https://github.com/rm-learning/dataScience_showcase).
